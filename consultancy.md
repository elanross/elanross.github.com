      <h3>On-site Consultancy</h3>
      <p><br>The majority of our client engagements result in on-site consultancy. Co-location provides a number of benefits, the most apparent being an improvement in communication.</p>
      <p>We are experienced and comfortable in client-facing situations and enjoy building healthy dialog between stakeholders. Clear communication is a pre-requisite for software which is understood, operates correctly and solves the real problem in hand. </p>
      <p>We undertake on-site consultancy on a contractual basis, typically for a fixed duration and rate.</p>
